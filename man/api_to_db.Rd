\description{
Based on a list of countries, retrieve coordinates from OSM api and
send the results to a database or database alternative.
}
\details{
Given a list of cities and country(ies) in a data frame (as tibble),
the function iterates over the values to find the coordinates, using
the function \code{coords_from_city} and send the results to a database

The data must be provided as a data frame, the unique identification
numbers must be provided in a column called "id". Other values that MUST be
provided are name of the cities and country in a 2-letter code.

The function uses \code{coords_from_city} for retreiving the data from the API,
therefore the values \code{state} and \code{county} are optional.
The results of the query are added to the database or database alternative.
When more than one result is found, only the first entry is added.
}
