This is a personal R package to facilitate the creation of Maps of Infrastructure per City (MAPIC).

The first stable version, 2.4.2, is able to create complete maps following the strategy of its parent project (a private version of the code).

The documentation for its usage is still to be improved. For now, details of the development and the concept can be found in the blog [[https://blog.rwhitedwarf.com/]] under the tag [[https://blog.rwhitedwarf.com/tags/maps-app][maps-app]]. 

The project is under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (GPL-3). Your are free to copy it and reproduce it.
